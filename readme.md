## Algorithm testing to remove bees from timelapse of broodframe images ##

### Libraries ###
* python: glob; numby; openvc-python; pybgs

To install pybgs with pip full library of opencv needs to be installed and to work with most algorithms we need to install opencv3!

`brew install opencv3`

### benchmark.py  ###

This python script runs multiple algorithms and creates the calculated backgroundimages and the writes the time to finish in a text file.
`python benchmark.py`

### video.py ###

Creates a video file from images in given folder
