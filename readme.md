## Algorithm testing to remove bees from timelapse of broodframe images ##

### Libraries ###
* python: glob; numby; openvc-python; pybgs

We need to use opencv version 3.x for best support with bgslibrary, see issue: https://github.com/andrewssobral/bgslibrary/issues/164

To install and use pybgs manually:

`brew install opencv@3`

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/andrewssobral/bgslibrary.git

cd bgslibrary
cd build

cmake -D BGS_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON -D OpenCV_DIR="your installed OpenCV directory" ..
make install
```

### benchmark.py  ###

This python script runs multiple algorithms and creates the calculated backgroundimages and the writes the time to finish in a text file.
`python benchmark.py`

### video.py ###

Creates a video file from images in given folder

`python video.py FOLDERNAME`
